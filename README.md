Perform Sentiment Analysis

this is not a project. I want to analyse patient reviews of my NHS GP to assess whether there is a prevalent issue with rudeness. The null hypothesis states that the staff are not generally rude, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that they are. If the proportion of negative reviews exceeds that of positive reviews, we will conclude that there is insufficient evidence to reject the alternative hypothesis.

The analysis shows that 60% of the reviews are negative, indicating a significant concern regarding professionalism. Based on this, it is advisable for the GP practice to improve its customer service and professional conduct to enhance patient satisfaction.
